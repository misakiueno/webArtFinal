      Based on the set of emojis from the latest versions of Apple software (macOS Mojave 10.14.1 and iOS 12.1.1), I selected ones that are specific to Japanese culture. Although there have been heated debates on which emojis should be added onto the list based on political and emotional sensitivity, it appears that the original emojis still remain to exist. These emojis, I believe, go against the trend of inclusivity and diversity, and thus why I chose to highlight.

      The linked videos are some that are informative, and some that are silly internet videos that make me question how people must perceive the Japanese culture.
      I am aware of my limitations that my views are Apple-centric.
